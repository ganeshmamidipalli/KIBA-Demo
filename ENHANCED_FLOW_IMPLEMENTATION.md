# ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced Flow Implementation - Complete**

## âœ… **What I've Implemented**

I've completely restructured the flow according to your requirements:

1. **Removed project summary from Step 3** (it's no longer necessary there)
2. **Step 3 is now "AI Follow-up Questions"** - shows follow-up questions after product details
3. **Step 4 is now "Project Confirmation"** - shows comprehensive summary for user review
4. **Step 5 is "Specifications"** - shows AI-generated recommendations
5. **Added major change detection** - if user edits major details, follow-up questions are re-triggered
